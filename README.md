# Introduction

This is another version of my [Image Grabber](https://github.com/Huzbi-crypto/Huzbi-ImgGrabber) extension that is made to just work. No details and no functionalities other than to click and download.

## Status

The code is in early stages.

The code can only get all images from the current active tab and download them. Right now, they can only run on a browser's console.

### How to Run on Browser Console

1. On Chrome, press `Ctrl+Shift+I` to open the browser's tool.
2. Click on the `Console` tab.
3. Copy and paste the code from `main.js` to the console.
